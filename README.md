# Voting System
SAE203 is a school project built to organize themed movie nights with a group: propose a date, a location, a film lineup, and let everyone vote to decide what actually gets picked. Built in PHP with MySQL, no framework.

## What it does
Recipe list filterable by category, with a detailed page per recipe (ingredients, steps, time, difficulty)
Live serving adjustment on the recipe page (quantities recalculated in JS)
User accounts: sign up / log in, with a "stay logged in" option (remember-me secured by token)
Admin dashboard to create, edit, and delete recipes
Image upload, automatically converted to AVIF + thumbnail generation
Contact form in a popup (AJAX, protected by a CSRF token)
Bilingual FR/EN site, auto-detected based on browser language

## Stack

Native PHP, MySQL/PDO, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No framework, no build tool. Images go through GD for AVIF conversion (requires PHP 8.1+).

## Server structure

The web root is **`www/public/`**. Anything that needs to be
reachable from the browser must live inside this folder.

## Security

A few things I put in place while learning about the topic:

* Passwords hashed with `password_hash` / `password_verify`
* Prepared SQL statements (PDO) everywhere, no query concatenation
* CSRF protection on sensitive forms (contact, recipe creation/editing)
* "Remember me" cookie based on a hashed selector/validator pair (no plaintext token stored server-side), rotated on every use
